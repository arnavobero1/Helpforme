    "Sometimes you just need to get to the heart of the matter. It can be difficult to see patterns and trends in a big pile of figures, and finding the average is often the first step towards seeing the bigger picture. With averages at your disposal, you’ll be able to quickly find the most representative values in your data and draw important conclusions. In this chapter, we’ll look at several ways to calculate one of the most important statistics in town—mean, median, and mode—and you’ll start to see how to effectively summarize data as concisely and usefully as possible."

    "The Statsville Health Club prides itself on its ability to find the perfect class for everyone. Whether you want to learn how to swim, practice martial arts, or get your body into shape, they have just the right class for you. The staff at the health club have noticed that their customers seem happiest when they’re in a class with people their own age, and happy customers always come back for more. It seems that the key to success for the health club is to work out what a typical age is for each of their classes, and one way of doing this is to calculate the average. The average gives a representative age for each\n",

    "A: Because there’s more than one sort of average.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to know what to call each average, so you can easily communicate which one you’re referring to. It’s a bit like going to your local grocery store and asking for a loaf of bread. The chances are you’ll be asked what sort of bread you’re after: white, whole-grain, etc. So if you’re writing up your sociology research findings, for example, you’ll be expected to specify exactly what kinds of average calculations you did.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Letters and numbers\n",
    "Almost every statistical calculation involves adding a bunch of numbers together. As an example, if we want to find the mean of\n",
    "the Power Workout class, we first have to add the ages of all the class attendees together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem statisticians have is how to generalize this. We don’t necessarily know in advance how many numbers we’re dealing with, or what they are. We currently know how many people are in the Power Workout class and what their ages are, but what if someone else joins the class? If we could only generalize this, we’d have a way of showing the calculation without rewriting it every time the class changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians get around this problem by using letters to represent numbers. As an example, they might use the letter x to represent ages in the Power Workout class like this:\n",

    "| 19 | $x_1$ |\n",
    "| 20 | $x_2$ |\n",
    "| 20 | $x_3$ |\n",
    "| 20 | $x_4$ |\n",
    "| 21 | $x_5$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each x represents the age of a separate person in the class. It’s a bit like labeling each person with a particular number x.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use x1 as a general way of representing this particular girl’s age. She’s 19 at the moment, but when she becomes 20, we’ll still know her age as $x_1$. We won’t have to rewrite any of our calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a general way of writing ages, we can use our x’s to represent them in calculations. We can write the sum of the 5 ages in the class as \n",

    "$Sum = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5$\n",
    "\n",
    "*But what if we don’t know how many numbers we have to sum? What if we don’t know how many people are in the class?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dealing with unknowns\n",
    "Statisticians use letters to represent unknown numbers. But what if we don’t know how many numbers we might have to add together? Not a problem—we’ll just call the number of values n. If we didn’t know how many people were in the Power Workout class, we’d just say that there were n of them, and write the sum of all the ages as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Sum = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 ... + x_n $\n",
    "\n",
    "The “...” is a quick way of saying “and so on.” In other words, just keep on adding x’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $x_n$ represents the age of the $n^{th}$ person in the class. If there were 18 people in the class, this would be $x_{18}$, the age of the $18^{th}$ person.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We can take another shortcut.**\n",
    "Writing $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 ... + x_n $ is a bit like saying “add age 1 to age 2, then add age 3, then add age 4, and keep on adding ages up to age n.” In day-to-day conversation it’s unlikely we’d phrase it like this. We’re far more likely to say “add together all of the ages.” It’s quicker, simpler, and to the point. We can do something similar in math notation by using the summation symbol $\\sum$, which is the Greek letter Sigma. We can use $\\sum x$ (pronounced “sigma x”) as a quick way of saying “add together the values of all the x’s.”\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 ... + x_n  = \\sum x$\n",

    "\n",
    "If the mean becomes misleading because of skewed data and outliers, then we need some other way of saying what a typical value is. We can do this by, quite literally, taking the middle value. This is a different sort of average, and it’s called the **median**.\n",

    "(19 19 20 20) (20) (21 21 100 102)\n",

    "\n",
    "The median is always in the middle. It’s the middle value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve seen that if you have 9 numbers, the median is the number at position 5. If you have 8 numbers, it’s the number at position 4.5 (halfway between the numbers at position 4 and 5). What about if you have n numbers?"

    "**Q: Is it still OK to use the mean with skewed data if I really want to?**\n",
    "A: You can, and people often do. However, in this situation the mean won’t give you the best representation of what a typical value is. You need the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: You say that, but surely the whole point of the mean is that it gives a typical value. It’s the average.**\n",
    "A: The big danger is that the mean will give a value that doesn’t exist in the data set. Take the Kung Fu class as an example. If you were to go into the class and pick a person at random, the chances are that person would be around 20 years old because most people in the class are that sort of age. Just going with the mean doesn’t give you that impression. Finding the median can give you a more accurate perspective on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes even the median will give a value that’s not in the data set, like our example on the previous page. That’s precisely why there’s more than one sort of average; sometimes you need to use different methods in order to accurately say what a typical value is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: So is the median better than the mean?**\n",
    "A: Sometimes the median is more appropriate than the mean, but that doesn’t make it better. Most of the time you’ll need to use\n",
    "the mean because it usually offers significant advantages over the median. The mean is more stable when you are sampling data. We’ll come back to this later in the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I use the mean or median with categorical data?**\n",
    "A: You can only find the mean and median of numerical data. Don’t worry, though, there’s another sort of average that deals with just this problem that we’ll explore later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: I always get right- and left-skewed data mixed up. How do I remember which is which?**\n",
    "A: Skewed data has a “tail” of outliers. To see which direction the data is skewed in, find the direction the tail is pointing in. For example, right-skewed data has a tail that points to the right."

    "This week’s interview: The many types of average\n",
    "\n",
    "Us: Hey, Average, great to have you on the show...\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: Please, call me Mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Us: Mean? But I thought you were Average. Did we mix up the guest list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: Not at all. You see, there’s more than one type of Average in Stats, and I’m one of them, the Mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Us: There’s more than one Average? That sounds kinda complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: Not really, not once you get used to it. You see, we all say what a typical value is for a set of numbers, but we have different opinions about how to say what that is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Us: So which one of you is the real Average? You know, the one where you add all the numbers together, and then divide by however many numbers there are?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: That’s me, but please don’t call me the “real” Average; the other guys might get offended. The truth is that a lot of people new to Stats see me as being Mr. Average. I have the same calculation that students see when they first encounter Averages in basic arithmetic. It’s just that in Stats, I’m called Mean to differentiate between the other sorts of Average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Us: So do you have any other names? \n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: Well, I do have a symbol, $\\mu$ . All the rock stars have them. Well, some of them do. I do anyway. It’s Greek, so that makes me exotic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Us: So why are any of the other sorts of Average needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: I hate to say it, but I have weaknesses. I lose my head a bit when I deal with data that has outliers. Without the outliers I’m fine, but then when I see outliers, I get kinda mesmerized and move towards them. It’s led to a few problems. I can sometimes end up well away from where most of the values are. That’s where Median comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Us: Median?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: He’s so level-headed when it comes to outliers. No matter what you throw at him, he always stays right in the middle of the data. Of course, the downside of the Median is that you can’t calculate him as such; you can only work out what position he\n",
    "should be in. It makes him a bit less useful further down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Us: Do the two of you ever have the same value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: We do if the data’s symmetric; otherwise, there tends to be differences between us. As a general rule, if there are outliers, then I tend to wander towards them, while Median stays where he is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Us: We’re running out of time, so here’s one final question. Are there any situations where both you and Median have problems saying what a typical value is?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: I’m afraid there is. Sometimes we need a little helping hand from another sort of Average. He doesn’t get out all that much, but he’s a useful guy to know. Stick around, and I’ll show you some of the things he’s up to.\n",

    "## Introducing the mode\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the mean and median, there’s a third type of average called the mode. The mode of a set of data is the most popular value, the value with the highest frequency. Unlike the mean and median, the mode absolutely has to be a value in the data set, and it’s the most frequent value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes data can have more than one mode. If there is more than one value with the highest frequency, then each one of these values is a mode. If the data looks as though it’s representing more than one trend or set of data, then we can give a mode for each set. If a set of data has two modes, then we call the data **bimodal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the situation we have with the Little Ducklings class. There are really two sets of ages we’re looking at, one for parents and one for children, so there isn’t a single age that’s totally representative of the entire class. Instead, we can say what the mode is for each set of ages. In the Little Ducklings class, ages 2 and 32 have the highest frequency, so these ages are both modes. On a chart, the modes are the ones with the highest frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It even works with categorical data\n",
    "The mode doesn’t just work with numeric data; it works with categorical data, too. In fact, it’s the only sort of average that works with categorical data. When you’re dealing with categorical data, the mode is the most frequently occurring category. You can also use it to specify the highest frequency group of values. The category or group with the highest frequency is called the **modal class**.\n",

    "### Three steps for finding the mode:\n",
    "1. Find all the distinct categories or values in your set of data.\n",
    "2. Write down the frequency of each value or category.\n",
    "3. Pick out the one(s) with the highest frequency to get the mode."
