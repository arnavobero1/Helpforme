normal = Gaussian distribution = bell shaped curve

mean = median = mode
No Skew

the y axis is the relative probability

2 normal distributions of babies and adults

they are plotted on the same number line

average baby height is 20"

average adult height is 70"

normal distributions are always centred around the average value

just by looking at the graph we can tell the average baby will be between 19 and 21 inches tall

adults are between 60 and 80 inches tall

curve for babies is way taller than that of adults

this is because there are many more possibilities for adult heights than for babies

the more options there are for height, the less likely any specific measurement will be one of them

width of the curve is defined by standard deviation 

babies have a relatively small sd compared to adults

sd babies = 0.6
sd adults = 4

normal curves are drawn so that 95% of measurements fall between +/- 2 sd around the mean

95% of the babies are 20+/-1.2 (0.6*2) inches
95% of the adults are 70+/-8 (4*2) inches



To draw a normal distribution, we need to know:
1) The average measurement : this tells us where the centre of the curve goes
2) The standard deviations of the measurements, this tells us how wide the curve should be.

And the with of the curve determines how tall it is.

The wider the curve, the shorter. The narrower the curve, the taller.

The curve tell us that there is a high probability of measuring a newborn baby boy within +/-1.2 inches of the mean and a low probability of measuring an adult within +/-1.2 inches of the mean.

Note, we are using the same y axis and comparing the probability of child and adult on the same graph

Normal distribution occurs in nature due tot he central limit theorem.
